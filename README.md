# Crop identification using deep learning
This code aims to support anyone interested in performing some crop diferentiation using satellite imagery applying machine and deep learning algoritms. In this experiment, the distinction between soybean and sugarcane in SÃ£o Paulo State is done using Sentinel-2 time series data. Here you can find:

* Dataset with sugarcane and soybean geometries
* Jupyter notebook with all the code
* Some examples of the formated data for input

There is a step by step leading through the final prediction.
1. Sentinel-2 time series extraction using GEE
2. Data visualization
3. Data preparation for the model
4. Classification algoritms: 
   4.1. K-means  
   4.2. Random Forest  
   4.3. Sequential (deep learning)  
5. Accuracy metrics

I hope you enjoy this example! Feel free to reach out for any questions :)

ps: this code was developed for a project under the MBA in Data Science by ESALQ-USP.
